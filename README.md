## Minimalistic Firefox userChrome.css tweak/theme for OS X

[CustomCSSforFX](https://github.com/Aris-t2/CustomCSSforFx) has a good tutorial on how to tweak Firefox with pure CSS only. This is my "theme" for Firefox Developer Edition. By enabling, you will be able to get Firefox to look like this:

### Installation

1. Go to Library/Application Support/Firefox, find your profile folder and create folder "chrome" (lowercase) under it
2. Copy userChrome.css file to that folder
3. Restart Firefox
